# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
This tool visualizes how different sorting algorithms work. Each element in the array is represented as a vertical bar that moves according to it's position (index) in the array.


Live version can be viewed here https://doddiskula.github.io/sorting-visualizer/.

## Algorithms
- Selection sort
- Quick sort (iterative)

More algorithms will be implemented!
